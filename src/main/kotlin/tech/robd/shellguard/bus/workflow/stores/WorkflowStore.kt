/*
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: Overview]
 * WorkflowStore is a per-session component that manages the lifecycle of workflow commands (ActionWorkflow)
 * for a single session, connection, or user. It provides:
 *   - Ordered queuing of workflow actions (using ConcurrentLinkedQueue for IDs)
 *   - Fast lookup by ID (using ConcurrentHashMap)
 *   - Fine-grained state management: submission, approval, execution, completion, cleanup
 *   - Integration with a global WorkflowEventBus for event-driven UI/log updates
 *   - Support for both strict in-order and out-of-order execution via IMMEDIATE_EXECUTE_APPROVAL
 *
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: Key Concepts]
 * - Only the next actionable workflow (not blocked) is eligible for execution, unless one is manually
 *   escalated via IMMEDIATE_EXECUTE_APPROVAL.
 * - Pop/removal always keeps the map and queue in sync.
 * - Periodic cleanup removes old/completed workflows from both structures.
 * - All commands/events are session-scoped; no state is shared between sessions.
 *
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: Typical Usage]
 * val store = sessionManager.getStore(sessionId)
 * store.add(workflow)                // Queue new workflow for approval/execution
 * val next = store.popNextActionable() // Pop the next actionable workflow for processing
 * store.cleanupCompleted(olderThan)  // Cleanup workflows older than a timestamp
 * store.getById(actionId)            // Lookup workflow by ID
 *
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: Thread Safety]
 * - All methods are thread-safe via concurrent collections.
 * - popNextActionable() is synchronized for atomic pop-and-remove semantics.
 * - If only ever accessed from a single thread per session, can use standard (non-concurrent) collections for performance.
 *
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: Extension Points]
 * - To support additional workflow states or custom event handling, modify CommandEventPhase and the event emission logic.
 * - To track more workflow metadata, extend ActionWorkflow or BusEvent as needed.
 *
 * [ðŸ“Œ Note: References]
 * - Used by [WorkflowSessionManager] to provide per-session state and queue isolation.
 * - Publishes to [WorkflowEventBus] for integration with dashboards, logs, or distributed systems.
