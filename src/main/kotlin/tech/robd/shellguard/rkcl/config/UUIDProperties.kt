 * [ðŸ§© Point: UUID config properties]
 * Configuration for UUID generatorâ€”mode (v1, v4, sequential, etc.), prefix, and namespace.
 * Expand for new UUID options, base name defaults, or distributed settings.
 *
 * Example (application.yml):
 *   uuid:
 *     mode: v4
 *     prefix: cmd
 *     baseName: my-app
 *     namespace: 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef
